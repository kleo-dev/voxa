## DM structure

The Direct-Message structure works like Email, but real-time and the node uses a temporary auth, a node is what stores messages that are sent by a user.

    participant AliceClient as Alice's Client
    participant AliceNode as Alice's Home Node (Node7)
    participant Voxa as Voxa Cloud
    participant BobNode as Bob's Home Node (Node2)
    participant BobClient as Bob's Client

    AliceClient->>Voxa: Lookup Bob's node
    Voxa-->>AliceClient: Respond with Bob â†’ Node2
    AliceClient->>BobNode: Send DM to bob
    BobNode-->>AliceClient: Acknowledge message stored
    BobNode->>BobClient: Notify new message
    BobClient-->>BobNode: Acknowledge received
    BobNode-->>AliceClient: Acknowledge received
```
